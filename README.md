# MOCTO In house design Exercise

Thank you so much for your interest in taking part on helping MoCTO produce our In House Design module! Please kindly go through this exercise and send your submissions over to racastillo@cto.nyc.gov

## Exercise Mechanics
Please accomplish this exercise no later than Thursday, Jun 3, 12pm ET. We will have a portion in the interview where we will be discussing your exercise submission.

Exercise is as follows:

1. We have sent you an invitation to access a github repository named at github.com/nyc-cto/in-house-design-challenge . Please clone this project and create a repository in your own github account with the name “MOCTO-CIF“ at the end of this exercise, we will ask you to send the link to that repository, we’d love it if you send it in the form `https://github.com/<your username>/in-house-design-challenge`


2. The application is a bare bones login page. Please kindly style the page in a sass file, based on the following house style for the button (the measurements do not need to be exact):

3. Here are optional tasks you can accomplish:
   
    * You can make the page mock-functional. 
    * Create a next page that a user goes to after they "log in"
    * Only allow a user with username “mocto” and password “HelloCodingItForward!” to "log in"
    * Anyone else should be disallowed from going to the next page with some appropriate error message. 
    * Make it interactive. Create listeners to the textboxes and make sure an event and validation is fired when the person using the application clicks “Login.”
    * Make it user-centered. Add texts, design, or however you want to change the look and feel of the page.
    * Make it accessible. The page could still be navigable with a screen reader.
    * Make it responsive. The application looks correct on different screens and devices.
    * Make it multi-lingual. Allow for multiple languages to be used.
    * Automate deployment. Set up a CI/CD pipeline from your repository to some form of hosting service.

**Note: You don’t have to do all of the items we have mentioned. Pick only the one(s) you are most drawn towards** 

*Please do not spend more than 1-2 hours on this (you should not have enough time to complete all tasks)*

Once you’ve finished this exercise, please send your accomplished repository to racastillo@cto.nyc.gov with the subject “<Name> - MOCTO/InhouseDesign Exercise” we will review this and we will be in touch!
