# MOCTO Coding it Forward Exercise

Thank you so much for your interest in joining the MOCTO team! Please kindly go through this exercise and send your submissions over to racastillo@cto.nyc.gov

## Exercise Mechanics
Please accomplish this exercise before your scheduled interview. We will have a portion in the interview where we will be discussing your exercise submission.

Exercise is as follows:

1. We have sent you an invitation to access a github repository named at github.com/nyc-cto/coding-it-forward. Please clone this project and create a repository in your own github account with the name “MOCTO-CIF“ at the end of this exercise, we will ask you to send the link to that repository, we’d love it if you send it in the form `https://github.com/<your username>/mocto-cif`


2. The application is a bare bones login page. We would like you to make the page functional. Only allowing user with username “mocto” with password “HelloCodingItForward!” to log in, with anyone else disallowed from going to the next page. There are no next page provided in the code, we would need you to create a page where the application will redirect if the correct username and password was submitted. 


3. We would love you to also accomplish any of the following:
    
    * Make it interactive. Create listeners to the textboxes and make sure an event and validation is fired when the person using the application clicks “Login.”
    * Make it user-centered. Add texts, design, or however you want to change the look and feel of the page.
    * Make it accessible. The page could still be navigable with a screen reader.
    * Make it responsive. The application looks correct on different screens and devices.

Note: You don’t have to do all 4 of the items we have mentioned. 

Once you’ve finished this exercise, please send your accomplished repository to racastillo@cto.nyc.gov with the subject “<Name> - MOCTO/CodingItForward Exercise” we will review this and will look forward to chatting with you about your work!
